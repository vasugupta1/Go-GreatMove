This project is a way of learning go 

Project aim is to get data from rightmove, use llm to summarize data and return data.
The data from the backend will then be used by front-end to show possible options

Need to add : 
1. Use images and feed them into the llm this way we can get a good description of what is key features
2. Store the values and description in the mongo db
3. expose chat line that queries all required things and returns a list of properties
4. Feature -> we want a way to compare properties
